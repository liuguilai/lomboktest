This is a dirty fork to play with a proof of concept about do notation for java.

The unique files added (no changes was maded to lombok itself) are:

* src/core/lombok/BindTo.java
* src/core/lombok/bind.java
* src/core/lombok/javac/handlers/HandleBind.java



========================

Project Lombok makes java a spicier language by adding 'handlers' that know how to build and compile simple, boilerplate-free, not-quite-java code.
See LICENSE for the Project Lombok license.


To start, run:

ant -projecthelp

HINT: If you'd like to develop lombok in eclipse, run 'ant eclipse' first. It creates the necessary project infrastructure and downloads dependencies. Note that, in order to run "LombokizedEclipse.launch", you need to have "Eclipse SDK" installed.
